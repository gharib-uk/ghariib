**Published :** March 22, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 8 hours, 44 minutes ago  
**Description :** The ProfileGrid – User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind and time-based SQL Injections via the rid and search parameters in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.4.7 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.

**Severity:** 6.5 | MEDIUM

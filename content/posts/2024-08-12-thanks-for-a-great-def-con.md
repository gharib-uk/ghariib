DEF CON 32 has wound down, and we want to thank our community for making this one stellar. You never fail to bring gigantic love and enthusiasm to every aspect of the Con, and we are inspired by your example.  
  
The curveball of a sudden, late-stage venue scramble could have spelled disaster, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Having so much of the Con back under one roof felt great! FIrst years in a new venue always mean some hiccups and learning experiences, but you reacted with patience and grace when they happened. For this you have our eternal gratitude.  
  
As always, if you want to keep that DEF CON feeling alive in the off-season, you can and should join a DEF CON Group in your area. If you can’t find one, we encourage you to start one ([https://defcongroups.org](https://defcongroups.org)). We also encourage you to check out our new project DEF CON Franklin ([https://defconfranklin.github.io](https://defconfranklin.github.io)) to find ways to put your skills to work where you live.  
  
As you return to your real lives, share your engagement ideas with us at [https://defcon.social](https://defcon.social) and we’ll amplify. Let’s motivate and encourage each other. Let’s stay engaged, with each other and the wider world.  
  
We’ll see you again just one short year from now in this same charming little place. In the meantime, keep learning and making new stuff, and look out for each other.  
  
☠️❤️🫵
